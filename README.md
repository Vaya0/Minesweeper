# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a game where you're on a grid, and your job is to find and flag all the hidden mines without accidentally setting them off. Here's how it works:

Imagine a grid like a checkerboard. Each square can be safe or have a hidden mine. Pick a square. If you're lucky, it's safe, and you'll see a number. That number tells you how many mines are nearby. Pay attention to the numbers. They show how many mines are touching that square, either next to it or diagonally. Don't click on a square with a mine! If you do, the game is over. If you think a square has a mine, you can mark it with a flag to be careful. You win when you've uncovered all the safe squares or marked all the mines correctly.
